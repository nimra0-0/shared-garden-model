# 🪴 Shared Garden (Model)
Ever wondered if a neural network can tell whether your doodle is a flower… or just chaotic squiggles? 🌸✏️
This repository contains the code to train a model that does exactly that.

The goal is simple: train and export an image classifier that can distinguish between:

* 🌸 **Flower doodles**
* ❌ **Not-flower doodles**

The model is trained on **hand-drawn sketches** from Google’s **QuickDraw dataset** and exported for easy reuse in future apps or demos(stay tuned — a fun interactive app is coming soon 👀).

For details on training and experimentation, see: <TK>

### Background

**Shared Garden** is a simple yet playful computer vision project inspired by **fastai Lesson 1**. I built it as a way to revisit and solidify the fundamentals of image classification by building something simple and fun.
